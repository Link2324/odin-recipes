    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These triple coffee sweet rolls have coffee in the dough, in the filling, and in the icing. With three hits of
        coffee, these came out incredibly well. They have a beautifully light, tender texture, and a huge amount of
        coffee flavor.

            mixture to shape a uniform log, wrapping up with the crease on the base.

        <li>Generously spread a 9x12-or 13-inch baking dish or container, and, whenever wanted, line the base with
            buttered material. Score the log of batter into 12 equivalent parts, and afterward cut each piece with a
            piece of string as displayed.
